I am an Assistant Professor in the [Geosciences Department](https://www.fortlewis.edu/academics/schools-departments/departments/geosciences-department/geosciences-home) at  [Fort Lewis College](https://www.fortlewis.edu/) in Durango, Colorado. I also direct our [Geographic Information Science Certificate](https://www.fortlewis.edu/academics/schools-departments/departments/geosciences-department/about-our-program/gis-certificate) program. In addition to my primary appointment at FLC, I hold a faculty appointment as a Hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's [Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/sbsc/about/gcmrc).

My research focuses on understanding physical and biological processes in river systems using field work, numerical modeling, and remote sensing techniques. I am currently working to understand the hydrologic impacts of large dams on the geomorphology, ecology, and land cover of the Colorado River corridor through the Canyonlands and Grand Canyon regions of the Southwestern U.S. I also conduct research on whether, and over what timescales, areas formerly inundated by reservoirs will undergo geomorphic and ecological recovery as those reservoirs decline in response to a changing climate and long-term drought. In addition to these field-based projects, Iâ€™ve conducted laboratory and numerical modeling studies of river response to altered hydrology and sediment supply.

At Fort Lewis College, I teach courses in river eco-geomorphology, GIS/Remote Sensing, and programming for spatial data analysis.
