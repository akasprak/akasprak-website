title: Sediment Budgeting from Remote Sensing and In-Situ Data
date: 2022-07-04T22:53:29.895Z
summary: A sediment budget measures how much material is being gained or lost by
  a landscape of interest over a given time period. Sediment budgets are
  frequently applied to rivers, dunefields, and coasts, and we're also beginning
  to quantify sediment budgets on planetary bodies beyond earth. Accurate
  sediment budgets are extremely important for managing natural resources so as
  to minimize erosion or deposition, protect infrastructure, and conserve
  habitat. One way of measuring the amount of sediment gained or lost by a
  landscape is to instrument that location and physically measure the mass or
  volume of sediment (we term this the 'in-situ method'), but that approach is
  logistically challenging, especially in remote locations. On the other hand,
  we can survey the elevation of the landscape over multiple periods in time
  using remote sensing methods like lidar, and the difference in landscape
  elevation can provide information as to the volume of sediment gained or lost
  over time. That's the only technique currently available in extremely remote
  areas, including other planetary bodies. However, it's unclear how and when
  the remote sensing method will exhibit agreement with the in-situ method. This
  set of projects looks at when and where we can reliably extract sediment
  budgets from easily-obtained remote sensing data.
