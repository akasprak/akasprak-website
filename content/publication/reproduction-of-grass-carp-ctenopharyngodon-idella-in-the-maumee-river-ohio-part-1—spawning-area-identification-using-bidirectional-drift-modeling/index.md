abstract: Control of invasive grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) populations
  in the Western Lake Erie Basin merits adaptive management guided by the best
  available science. Presently (2024), capture of mature grass carp in rivers
  during spawning season is most efficient, so knowing when and where grass carp
  are spawning is essential information for natural resource agencies. Using
  bidirectional drift modeling and grass carp ichthyoplankton samples captured
  in the Maumee River during the 2017–2019 spawning seasons, this study
  identified 12 probable grass carp spawning areas in the lower 96.5-kilometers
  of the Maumee River. These spawning areas were located both above and below
  the Grand Rapids/Providence low-head dams. Three areas showed evidence of
  multiyear use, while nine had multi-event use. Spawning activity had no
  definitive diel variation and occurred at an average photoperiod of 15.15 h.
  The maturation metric ADD15, or annual degree days above 15 degrees Celsius,
  generally exceeded the 655 threshold for spawning; however, some spawning
  occurred when ADD15 ≤235, indicating spawners likely matured in a warmwater
  discharge. The probable spawning areas were generally characterized by mean
  velocities between 0.4 and 2.1 m per second (with locally higher velocities
  possible), areas of high turbulence produced by dam spillways or bedrock
  outcroppings, channel constrictions, confluences, islands, and bridges with
  piers in the water. Spawning suitability indices (SSI), based on velocity,
  varied considerably between spawning areas and SSI models. These results could
  be used to inform control efforts and predict potential grass carp spawning
  locations in other rivers under threat of invasion.
