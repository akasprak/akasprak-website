abstract: As a result of hydrologic drought and increasing consumptive water
  use, reservoirs worldwide are experiencing declines in storage. The emergent
  landscapes exposed by falling water levels may be colonized by novel
  vegetation communities in terms of species composition and succession, and/or
  reworked by geomorphic processes at sub-annual to decadal timescales. Despite
  research on the response of downstream river reaches to dam and reservoir
  operations, we know little regarding the eco-geomorphic processes that shape
  backwater reaches upstream of reservoirs. Here we use a decadal-scale record
  of aerial imagery and support vector machine learning to classify land cover
  change along more than 140 kilometers of the Colorado and San Juan River
  backwaters within Lake Powell in Utah. Our results along both rivers reveal a
  consistent trajectory of land cover change, wherein declining water levels
  expose bare sediment, which is subsequently colonized by vegetation. With
  continued water level declines, vegetation exhibits defoliation consistent
  with plant water stress. Similar patterns of landscape evolution were observed
  with regard to exposure age of formerly-inundated surfaces on both study
  rivers, wherein older surfaces were marked by bare sediment and/or stressed
  vegetation. Divergence in response to reservoir drawdown between systems was
  observed with regard to the downstream propagation rate of land cover changes.
  Specifically, on the steep-and-narrow Colorado River, the successional
  trajectory of bare sediment to green vegetation to stressed vegetation
  occurred more rapidly as water levels declined than on the San Juan River. The
  observations detailed in this study may guide reservoir management to promote
  recruitment of desirable land cover types (e.g., native and/or complex
  ecosystems) under shifting water supply.
