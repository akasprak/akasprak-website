abstract: Reliable estimates of low flow and flood discharge at ungaged
  locations are required for evaluating stream flow alteration, designing
  culverts and stream crossings, and interpreting regional surveys of habitat
  and biotic condition. Very few stream gaging stations are located on small,
  remote streams, which typically have complex channel morphology. Adequate
  gaging is also lacking on larger streams that are remote, smaller than those
  typically gaged, or have channel morphology not conducive to installation of
  gages. Complex channels typically contain large scale hydraulic roughness
  elements that dominate flow patterns (i.e., form roughness), making it
  difficult to measure channel cross-section area and water velocity, or to
  measure channel volume even where discharge is known. In channels with large
  channel form roughness, it is equally difficult to estimate discharge using
  commonly applied equations based on slope and channel dimensions or basin
  area. We employed a novel approach that explicitly accounts for hydraulic
  resistance from large wood and riffle-pool morphology (form roughness) in
  calculating low flow and bankfull discharge from stream and river physical
  habitat data collected from 4229 stream and river sites in the conterminous US
  (CONUS) sampled in 2008–9 and 2013–14 as part of the US Environmental
  Protection Agency's National Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA). Hydraulic
  resistance derived from form roughness clearly dominated resistance derived
  from bed particles (particle resistance) during summer low flows in wadeable
  streams across the spectrum of channel slopes and substrate sizes smaller than
  boulders. Under bankfull conditions, the influence of form resistance relative
  to particle resistance was diminished, but form resistance still dominated
  except in large low gradient rivers lacking complex channels, and in streams
  or rivers with boulder-size bed particles. We validated our hydraulic
  resistance estimates by comparing measured discharges with calculated
  discharges that used those hydraulic resistance estimates along with measured
  NRSA channel morphology data. Morphology-based summer discharge (low flow)
  estimates and direct field measurements of discharge in 2333 wadeable CONUS
  streams showed reasonable agreement (median difference < 2.5×) for discharges
  ranging from 3.6 × 10−5 to 123 m3/s and drainage areas of 0.12 to 171,000 km2.
  In a subset of 759 of NRSA's larger wadeable stream and non-wadeable river
  sites where nearby U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gage data were available and
  adequate, our morphology-based summer discharge estimates agreed fairly well
  (median difference < 2.0×) with USGS 20-yr average August mean flows ranging
  from 0.003 to 16,000 m3/s. Similarly, morphology-based estimates of bankfull
  flow ranging from 0.3 to 100,000 m3/s agreed reasonably well with the 1.5-yr
  recurrence interval flood in these gaged sites (median deviation <2.2×). These
  findings demonstrate the importance of quantifying flow resistance from
  large-scale form roughness features in natural channels and provide a novel
  approach for estimating discharge from widely available survey data. This will
  allow examination of discharge and its ecological influence across the full
  range of stream and river sizes sampled by NRSA or other synoptic surveys
  where comprehensive measures of biota, physical habitat, and chemistry are
  also made. Although these morphology-based estimates exhibit some variability,
  they are adequate for examining regional patterns in discharge and flow
  alteration and their association with instream biota and anthropogenic
  disturbances, providing summer low and bankfull flow information where
  reliable estimates are lacking.
