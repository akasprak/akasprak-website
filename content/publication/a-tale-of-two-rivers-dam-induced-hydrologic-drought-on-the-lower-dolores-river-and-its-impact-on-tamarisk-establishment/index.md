abstract: The effects of river regulation on the flow patterns of rivers in
  western North America often mimic the impacts of naturally occurring episodic
  drought. On the Dolores River in southwestern Colorado, two distinct periods
  of flow modification have occurred, with very different drought-like
  consequences for downstream habitat. The first period of major irrigation
  diversions (1889â€“1984) led to extreme low flows during the summer months with
  little change to spring peak flows. The second period after dam construction
  (1984 to present) caused a decline in peak flows but an increase in summer
  minimum flows. We studied the role of these different flow regimes in
  promoting the recruitment of non-native tamarisk, since understanding historic
  patterns of recruitment may inform current and future flow management. We used
  dendrochronology to determine tamarisk establishment dates and tested the
  connection between establishment years and a suite of hydroclimatic variables.
  Tamarisk recruitment occurred between 1952 and 2002, with 92% of trees
  establishing during the first flow diversion period. The strongest
  hydroclimate predictor was low minimum flow for a given year, especially when
  coupled with higher peak flows in the year of, or before, establishment.
  Almost no tamarisk recruitment has occurred in the second, dam-controlled
  period, where lowered peak flows and elevated minimum flows prevail. In spite
  of the drought tolerance of tamarisk, drought-like conditions below this dam
  did not promote its invasion. Instead, the combination of lowered peaks but
  increased summer baseflows post-dam has driven channel narrowing and
  vegetation encroachment by native willows. What current and future
  meteorologic drought conditions, coupled with dam-controlled flows, will bring
  to the channel and adjacent riparian vegetation is uncertain, but this work
  may help to forecast the impacts of future river flows on riparian vegetation
  community evolution.
