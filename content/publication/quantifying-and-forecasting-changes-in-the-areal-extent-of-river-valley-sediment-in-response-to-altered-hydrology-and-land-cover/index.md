abstract: In river valleys, sediment moves between active river channels,
  near-channel deposits including bars and floodplains, and upland environments
  such as terraces and aeolian dunefields. Sediment availability is a
  prerequisite for the sustained transfer of material between these areas, and
  for the eco-geomorphic functioning of river networks in general. However, the
  difficulty of monitoring sediment availability and movement at the reach or
  corridor scale has hindered our ability to quantify and forecast the response
  of sediment transfer to hydrologic or land cover alterations. Here we leverage
  spatiotemporally extensive datasets quantifying sediment areal coverage along
  a 28 km reach of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon, southwestern USA. In
  concert with information on hydrologic alteration and vegetation encroachment
  resulting from the operation of Glen Canyon Dam (constructed in 1963) upstream
  of our study reach, we model the relative and combined influence of changes in
  (a) flow and (b) riparian vegetation extent on the areal extent of sediment
  available for transport in the river valley over the period from 1921 to 2016.
  In addition, we use projections of future streamflow and vegetation
  encroachment to forecast sediment availability over the 20 year period from
  2016 to 2036. We find that hydrologic alteration has reduced the areal extent
  of bare sediment by 9\% from the pre- to post-dam periods, whereas vegetation
  encroachment further reduced bare sediment extent by 45\%. Over the next 20
  years, the extent of bare sediment is forecast to be reduced by an additional
  12\%. Our results demonstrate the impact of river regulation, specifically the
  loss of annual low flows and associated vegetation encroachment, on reducing
  the sediment available for transfer within river valleys. This work provides
  an extendable framework for using high-resolution data on streamflow and land
  cover to assess and forecast the impact of watershed perturbation (e.g. river
  regulation, land cover shifts, climate change) on sediment connectivity at the
  corridor scale.
