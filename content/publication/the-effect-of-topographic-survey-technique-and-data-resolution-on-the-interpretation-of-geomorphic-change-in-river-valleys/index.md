abstract: Change detection of high resolution topographic data is commonly used
  in river valleys to quantify reach- and site-scale sediment budgets by
  estimating the erosion/deposition volume, and to interpret the geomorphic
  processes driving erosion and deposition. Field survey data are typically
  collected as point clouds that are often converted to gridded raster datasets
  and the ultimate choice of grid resolution is left to the user. This choice
  may have important implications for both the quantification and interpretation
  of geomorphic change. Here we used concurrent topographic data collected by
  terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and structure-from-motion (SfM)
  photogrammetry to quantify the influence of grid resolution and sampling
  technique on (a) the sediment budget and (b) the presence and role of
  geomorphic processes (i.e., alluvial, colluvial, aeolian, and fluvial
  transport) driving topographic change at four sites along the Colorado River
  in Grand Canyon, Arizona, USA. We found that while both techniques produced
  similar estimates for site-scale sediment budgets, the magnitude of detected
  topographic change was dampened at coarser pixel resolutions. An overall
  decrease in the areal extent of erosion and deposition were observed,
  respectively, when coarsening pixel size from 5 cm to 1 m among all sites.
  Coarser resolution data tended to affect interpretation of landscape change
  along the margins of river valleys. For example, when changing from 5 cm to 1
  m pixel resolution, the inferred contribution of aeolian changes to total
  site-scale geomorphic change increased in area by 7.9%, whereas the inferred
  contribution of alluvial and colluvial processes decreased in area by 97.9%
  and 88.2%, respectively. More generally, we found that coarsening pixel sizes
  disproportionately attributed geomorphic change to one or more of the most
  common processes operating at a site. We also found that coarsening pixel
  resolution amplified the net sediment imbalance at the site scale, driving the
  imbalance at erosional sites further into erosion and vice versa for
  depositional sites. Our results have implications both for point cloud data
  collection and for raster dataset processing. We argue that selecting the
  finest obtainable resolution is not always warranted to accurately quantify
  and interpret geomorphic change, because remote sensing technique, topographic
  data resolution, and analysis procedure can be optimized to capture the
  spatial scale of those processes driving landscape change. However, in
  landscapes at or near sediment equilibrium (i.e., equal amounts of erosion and
  deposition), the finest obtainable topographic data resolution is warranted to
  avoid amplifying sediment imbalance and erroneously inferring that sites are
  trending toward erosion or deposition.
