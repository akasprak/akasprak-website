abstract: Sedimentary landforms on Earth and other planetary bodies are built
  through scour, transport, and deposition of sediment. Sediment connectivity
  refers to the hypothesis that pathways of sediment transport do not occur in
  isolation, but rather are mechanistically linked. In dryland river systems,
  one such example of sediment connectivity is the transport of fluvially
  deposited sediment by wind. However, predictive tools that can forecast
  fluvial-aeolian sediment connectivity at meaningful scales are rare. Here we
  develop a suite of models for quantifying the availability of river-sourced
  sediment for aeolian transport as a function of river flow, wind regime, and
  land cover across 168 km of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon, USA. We
  compare and validate these models using topographic changes observed over 10
  years in a coupled river sandbar-aeolian dunefield setting. The models provide
  a path forward for directly linking fluvial hydrology with the management and
  understanding of aeolian landscapes.
