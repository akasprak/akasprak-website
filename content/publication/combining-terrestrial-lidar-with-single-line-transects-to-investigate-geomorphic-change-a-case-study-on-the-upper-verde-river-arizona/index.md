abstract: The Upper Verde River in northern Arizona, USA is a vital resource for
  the wildlife and humans that rely on its waters. We characterize the riparian
  corridor topography using terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) data from 2021 to
  2022. We also quantify geomorphic changes associated with human and
  climate-driven alterations in river flow and vegetation changes by combining
  the contemporary lidar surveys with legacy measurements from single line
  geomorphology transects measured by the United States Forest Service (USFS) in
  2009. Seventeen plots along the Upper Verde River were surveyed with the TLS
  and the data were coregistered within individual plots with a Root Mean Square
  Error of <0.03 m among scan positions. Digital Elevation Models (DEM) were
  derived for each plot from the TLS data at 10 cm resolution and compared to
  the 2009 USFS cross-section data to quantify elevation changes. In areas with
  statistically significant change, we detected maximum changes in elevation due
  to erosion and deposition of −0.37 m and + 0.97 m, respectively. Topographic
  changes over the 13-year period were predominately aggradation and associated
  with sediment deposition, which we hypothesize might have resulted from
  altered river flow and vegetation encroachment. This study also demonstrates a
  quantitative and statistical methodology to fuse traditional single line
  cross-section data with contemporary lidar data to quantify geomorphic change.
  The novel approach demonstrated here is broadly applicable to natural resource
  managers for integrating and contextualizing legacy topographic data for
  understanding past, present, and future landscape and habitat changes.
