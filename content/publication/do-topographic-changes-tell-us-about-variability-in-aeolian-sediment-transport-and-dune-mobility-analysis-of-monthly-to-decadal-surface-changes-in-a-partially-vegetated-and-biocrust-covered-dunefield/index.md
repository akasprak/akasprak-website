abstract: Vegetation and biological soil crust (biocrust) cover can have a
  stabilizing effect on dunes by fixing sediment in-place and increasing surface
  roughness, thus limiting dune mobility, sediment transport, and erosion. These
  biological effects influence rates of aeolian activity and thus surficial
  changes, though variability in wind and sediment supply may obscure these
  topographic effects. In this study, we compare monthly measures of sediment
  transport and decadal estimates of dune mobility to repeat topographic changes
  measured as a net volume change in sediment storage (difference in volume
  between all positive and negative topographic changes) and total volume change
  (absolute summed volume of all positive and negative changes) for areas of
  bare, vegetated, and biocrusted sand within a dunefield with limited sediment
  supply and unimodal winds. We found that monthly net volume changes normalized
  by area were similar between bare sand and sand with at least 20 % vegetation
  cover. However, total volume change was significantly greater for bare sand
  and correlated with monthly sediment flux estimates (R2 = 0.46), though the
  relationship was significantly improved by including monthly changes in
  surface roughness (R2 = 0.8). Longer-term decadal trends in topographic change
  showed larger total volume changes with the greatest decreases in vegetation
  canopy cover. Additionally, decadal total volume changes strongly correlated
  with estimates of dune mobility (R2 = 0.99). We also found that increased
  total volume changes did not necessarily signal increased net volume changes
  for all land cover types. Specifically, increases in total volume change for
  bare sand resulted in near equal or lower net volume changes, as both positive
  (deposition) and negative (erosion) change increased with sediment transport.
  Conversely, less mobile land covers, such as biocrust covered sand, increased
  in erosion without significant increases in total volume change, demonstrating
  that more stable surfaces might exhibit a larger topographic change imbalance
  than mobile sediment surfaces under the same conditions. This study highlights
  the importance of considering multiple measures of topographic change for
  interpreting sediment mobility, transport, and availability. Additionally, we
  hypothesize a novel framework for remote sensing-based empirical studies aimed
  at interpreting aeolian landscape evolution resulting from climate change
  effects on weather as well as biological controls such as vegetation and
  biocrusts.
