abstract: Sediment transfer, or connectivity, by aeolian processes between
  channel-proximal and upland deposits in river valleys is important for the
  maintenance of river corridor biophysical characteristics. In regulated river
  systems, dams control the magnitude and duration of discharge. Alterations to
  the flow regime driven by dams that increase the inundation duration of
  sediment, or which drive the encroachment of vegetation into areas formerly
  composed of labile sediment and result in channel narrowing, may reduce
  sediment transfer from near-channel deposits to uplands via aeolian processes.
  Employing spatial methods developed by Kasprak et al (2018 Prog. Phys.
  Geogr.), here we use data describing the areal extent of bare (i.e.
  subaerially exposed and non-vegetated) sediment along 168 km of the Colorado
  River downstream from Glen Canyon Dam in Grand Canyon, USA, in conjunction
  with inundation extent modeling to forecast how future flows of this highly
  regulated river will drive changes in the areal extent of sediment available
  for aeolian transport. We also compare modern bare sediment area to that which
  presumably would have existed under pre-dam hydrographs. Over the next two
  decades, the planned flow regime from Glen Canyon Dam will result in slight
  decreases in bare sediment area (−1%) on an annual scale. This is in contrast
  to pre-dam years, when unregulated low flows led to marked increases in bare
  sediment area as compared to the current discharge regime. Our findings also
  indicate that ∼75% of bare sediment in the study reach is inundated
  continuously at present, owing to increased baseflows in the post-dam flow
  regime; consequently, any reductions in flows below modern-day low discharges
  have the potential to expose large areas of bare sediment. We use vegetation
  modeling to quantify areas susceptible to vegetation encroachment under future
  flows, finding that 80% of bare sediment area is suitable for colonization by
  invasive tamarisk under the current flow regime. Our findings imply that the
  Colorado River in Grand Canyon, a system marked by widespread erosion of
  sediment resources and encroachment of riparian vegetation in the post-dam
  period, is likely to continue to see decreasing bare sediment extent over the
  coming decades in the absence of direct intervention through flow regime
  modification or widespread vegetation removal.
