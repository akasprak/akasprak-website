abstract: Sediment budgets are fundamentally important for planetary science.
  However, only one primary method, based on remote sensing, is currently
  available for determining extraterrestrial sediment budgets. For determining
  sediment budgets on Earth, both in-situ and remote sensing methods are
  available. Despite the widespread use of the two methods, there has been
  surprisingly little research on how well the sediment budgets produced by
  these two approaches reconcile with one another, which highlights the lack of
  quantitative understanding of errors for sediment budgets measured with remote
  sensing in planetary research. Therefore, there is a general need to expand
  our knowledge of sediment budgets. Here we use a background review and analog
  case study of an aeolian dunefield in Grand Canyon, Earth to frame a path
  forward for addressing shortcomings of remote sensing sediment budgets on
  Mars. We estimate a 53% percent difference in the sediment budget determined
  with remote sensing relative to in-situ methods for a simple endmember
  scenario of a dunefield within a unimodal wind directional regime and no
  external sediment supply. However, when we incorporated key sources of
  uncertainty in remote sensing change detection following methods commonly used
  by geomorphologists on Earth, the estimates of sediment budget differences
  relative to the in-situ method spanned a much larger range, from 3% to 138%.
  Our case study also suggests that sediment budget errors could be much larger
  under more complex wind direction, sediment supply, and physiographic
  settings, and that variability in those landscape characteristics might be
  used to better estimate errors for dunefield sediment budgets. We conclude
  that by comparing sediment budgets derived from in-situ measurements of
  sediment fluxes and from remote sensing measurements at many more analog sites
  on Earth, the aeolian research community, and the geomorphology discipline,
  could gain an understanding of the errors of the remote sensing method, which
  is used by investigators on other planetary bodies such as Mars. This could
  improve the ability to quantify sediment budgets on Mars – and, in the future,
  other planetary environments where high-resolution topographic data are
  available – as well as directly improve our ability to interpret
  extraterrestrial landscape evolution related to climate, weather, and geologic
  history.
